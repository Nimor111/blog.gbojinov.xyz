My personal blog, build on Hugo and using the wonderful [[https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal][Terminal]] theme.
Posts are written in an org mode file ~posts.org~, and I use [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] to export it to hugo markdown.

** Building locally
The project comes with a nix shell as a development environment. Install [[https://nixos.org/download.html][Nix]] and then run the following command from the root of the project:

#+begin_src sh
nix-shell shell.nix
#+end_src

You can also use [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]].

Also make sure to initialize the theme submodules

#+begin_src sh
git submodule update --init
#+end_src

After that you can use the =Makefile= commands.
To build the site:
#+begin_src sh
make build
#+end_src

To run locally:
#+begin_src sh
make run
#+end_src

To build and push to git
#+begin_src sh
make deploy
#+end_src
